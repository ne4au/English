In the [[serene]] setting of a park on the cliff’s [[ledge]], just as the golden light became [[incandescent]] on the horizon, an artist set up his [[easel]] among the trees. He was [[utterly]] focused on capturing the landscape before him, [cherishing](cherish) every moment of quiet that allowed his mind to work without interruption. He would often [[mutter]] to himself about colors and light, but today he was unusually silent, lost in thoughts he wouldn’t dare [[blab]] [[aloud]].

Nearby, a young man observed, [[keenly]] fascinated by the artist’s skill. He wanted to ask questions, but he held back, afraid of appearing [[bigoted]] by assuming the artist’s thoughts. He felt [[remorse]] for past moments when he had let his assumptions get the better of him.

Soon, a few parkgoers noticed the scene, gathering respectfully nearby. They watched with interest as the artist worked, their comments ranging from admiring to critical. One man, in particular, seemed [[utterly]] intent on [peeving](peeve) everyone around him by [reciting](recite) [[doggerel]] verses he claimed were poetic masterpieces. His display would normally leave others [distressed](distress), but the artist seemed [[impartial]], only pausing to listen as if it were an [[encore]] performance.

As if to [[swerve]] away from the distractions, the artist took a step back, ready to [[lunge]] into his final strokes. Just then, a [[bereaved]] woman wandered into the park, her face marked by sorrow as she held a portrait, likely of a loved one. Her expression conveyed deep [[anguish]], and she was clearly [[beset]] by grief. Moved, the artist decided to [[tow]] his supplies over to her and offer comfort, or at least a moment of quiet [[solace]].

One of the onlookers, ever skeptical, began to [[surmise]] that the artist was trying to win the crowd’s [[commendation]] with this public act of kindness. “It’s all for show,” he [[mutter]]ed, casting [[deplorable]] looks as though he alone could read the artist’s intentions. But most of the others found this act [[genuine]], admiring the artist’s ability to balance both his art and his compassion without any [[subterfuge]].

Finally, as night settled in, the artist’s thoughts returned to his work. Despite the [[distress]] he sensed in others, he couldn’t help but feel that he should [[seize]] the moment. He resolved to keep painting, to [[exert]] himself fully without regret. However, sensing a new resolve, he didn’t hesitate to [[rescind]] some of his earlier strokes. Art, he thought, was as much about letting go as holding on. He worked with a renewed [[keenness]], the canvas was his sanctuary [[amid]] the soft, evening shadows.
